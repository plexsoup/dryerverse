# GAME FEEL

	# if you need to use mouse to aim the grappling hook, then clicking should shoot the hook too.
	
	# get the dialog boxes down to 2 lines each
	
	# add a ceiling to the house level
	
	# pressing left and right while on a grappling hook should move you along the normal tangent.
	
	
	# you should be able to jump from the yarn
	
	# make animations for the sock: either paper cutouts or skeletal polygon deformations

# BUGS
	# first shot moves to (0,0) for no reason.
	# shouldn't be able to shoot while dialog box is up.
	
	
	# bullet doesn't follow tilemap when it's rotating.
	
	
	
# ideas:
	# platformer with sock as main character.
		# You're trapped in the dryer dimension, trying to get back to your partner.
		# Use your yarn as grappling hook.
		# platformer levels rotate
		# Aesthetic: industrial, cyber, yarn, stitchpunk
		
		
	# grappling hook runner game.
		# like canabalt or bit trip runner, but with web swinging
	# bowl of spaghetti ascends to godhood
		# strands can be used a bit like earthworm jim
		# meatballs have another purpose
	
	# friend-em-up or charm-em-up.
		# you have to get through a crowd, by providing them what they want.
		# slingshot topics of conversation into the individuals.
			# FORD Method. Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams.
			
	# you are the AI trying to make phone calls to book a restaurant reservation.
		# search your databanks and retrieve the correct responses.
