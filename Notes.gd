# TODO:
	
	# bug: on first level, grapple gun relocates hook if player hasn't moved.
	# bug: players can inch along surfaces by rapid clicking the mouse.
		# add a distance limiter on the grappling gun, so they have to shoot some distance away from their attachment point.
		
	
	# on nextLevel(), you should remove old bullets.
	
	# water sprites don't always move.
	
	
	# add boundary collision areas to (Levels 1 and 3) to detect when character falls out of level
		# Bug. If you fall off the world on level 2, on restarting, the player collision area seems disabled. (falls through earth)
	

	# game over animation should return to dryer from level 3.
		# or, make a key or timer to restart the game.
	
	

	
# GAME FEEL

	# if you need to use mouse to aim the grappling hook, then clicking should shoot the hook too.
	
	# get the dialog boxes down to 2 lines each
	
	# add a ceiling to the house level
	
	# pressing left and right while on a grappling hook should move you along the normal tangent.
	
	
	# you should be able to jump from the yarn
	
	# make animations for the sock: either paper cutouts or skeletal polygon deformations

# BUGS
	# first shot moves to (0,0) for no reason.
	# shouldn't be able to shoot while dialog box is up.
	
	
	# bullet doesn't follow tilemap when it's rotating.
	
	
	
# ideas:
	# platformer with sock as main character.
		# You're trapped in the dryer dimension, trying to get back to your partner.
		# Use your yarn as grappling hook.
		# platformer levels rotate
		# Aesthetic: industrial, cyber, yarn, stitchpunk
		
		
	# grappling hook runner game.
		# like canabalt or bit trip runner, but with web swinging
	# bowl of spaghetti ascends to godhood
		# strands can be used a bit like earthworm jim
		# meatballs have another purpose
	
	# friend-em-up or charm-em-up.
		# you have to get through a crowd, by providing them what they want.
		# slingshot topics of conversation into the individuals.
			# FORD Method. Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams.
			
	# you are the AI trying to make phone calls to book a restaurant reservation.
		# search your databanks and retrieve the correct responses.
